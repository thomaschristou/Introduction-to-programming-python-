- The python that I run this code on is python 3.9.7 64-bit
- On this version instead of showing tags as red as i had requested it is not able to do so due to a glitch in this version
- Instead to show what books are overdue I have highlighted them in bold
- I also added features such as the ability to record checking in and checking out books not on the current date as if computers malfunction for a day, then the records of what books have 
 been taken out may be incorrect to the real data so when the system comes back online the librarian can update as such. However, if you want to check-out or check in a book for the current 
 date then you can leave the column blank and the program will autofill it.
- I also added the feature to recommend a series of books from the booksearch tab so that the librarian can suggest books based on ones being checked out
- Running code that changes the files outside the GUI can cause the program to not work as intended when it is run again but these functions/subroutines are labelled with warnings as they 
need to be done in conjunction for the program to work
-You can also search by things other than the book title and more than one entry box can be filled at a time for this search e.g. genre and author etc
-When searching for a book you can search with or without underscores but is case sensitive
-Tables do not always automatically update for other tabs after a task is performed
